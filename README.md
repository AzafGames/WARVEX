## 📌 About the Project

WARVEX is being developed as a PC-focused third-person shooter, initially targeting a single-player, offline experience.

The player will navigate hostile environments, engage enemies, complete mission objectives, and reach extraction points. Development will begin with a small playable prototype before expanding into a more complete game.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a responsive third-person player controller.
- Develop satisfying aiming and shooting mechanics.
- Implement reusable weapon and damage systems.
- Create enemies with patrol, detection, and combat behaviors.
- Design engaging mission-based gameplay.
- Develop a functional HUD, menus, and gameplay feedback.
- Optimize the game for Windows PC.
- Deliver a standalone, playable game build.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before opening WARVEX, you will need:

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
- Unity Editor **6.6**, using the version selected for this project
- A compatible Windows development environment
- Git for version control, if working with the repository through Git
- Windows Build Support in Unity Hub when building for Windows

### Open the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Unity Hub.
3. Select **Add** or **Add project from disk**.
4. Select the root folder containing the Unity project.
5. Open the project using the intended Unity Editor version.
6. Allow Unity to import the assets and packages.
7. Open the available test or gameplay scene to start development.

**Important:** A usable Unity project must contain the required project files, including `Assets/`, `Packages/`, and `ProjectSettings/`. A README-only repository is documentation rather than a complete playable project.

## 🧪 Testing and Development

During development, the game will be tested incrementally.

Testing priorities include:

- Player movement and camera collision.
- Weapon firing, ammunition, and reloading.
- Damage, health, and death behavior.
- Enemy navigation and target detection.
- Mission objectives and completion conditions.
- UI interaction and scene transitions.
- Performance and stability in standalone builds.

Features will be marked as complete only after they have been implemented and tested.

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

After the first playable mission is complete, potential expansions may include:

- Additional missions and environments.
- More weapons and enemy types.
- Improved enemy tactics and cover mechanics.
- Weapon pickups and customization.
- Higher-quality character animation and effects.
- Additional difficulty settings.
